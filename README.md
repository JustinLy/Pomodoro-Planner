**Pomodoro Planner** is a desktop application that combines a traditional task scheduler with the Pomodoro time management technique to help users complete their to-do lists with increased productivity and convenience.

**What is the Pomodoro Technique?** Check out this link! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique

# How It Works: #
Users create tasks they intend to do, specifying the number of "Pomodoros" they plan to spend on each task (A Pomodoro is a pre-defined unit of time, such as 25 minutes). After they've finished scheduling tasks, they click "Start Working" on the Task Scheduler, instructing the app to begin working through their task lists and timing each task using the Pomodoro Technique. The app will time the unfinished task at the top of the list and alert users when a Pomodoro is completed, when the Task itself is completed, when to take breaks and for how long; this allows users to not only schedule their tasks around the Pomodoro Technique, but also completely automate the usage of the Pomodoro Technique with their schedule, allowing them to focus on getting the job done!

# Installation #
